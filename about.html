<p class="about">
  Hello, dear reader, I'm Matthew. For whatever reason you've navigated to this page on this site, to learn more about who I am, and I'm happy to assist you in that process!
  <br>
  <br>
  I grew up in Illinois, and attended college in Colorado. My formal education was in psychology and philosophy, and was driven more by a desire to expand my understanding of how I and my fellow humans relate to ourselves, each other, and the world at large, than it was by a visions of a career. Correspondingly, I found my bachelors degree in psychology offered little in the way of promising job opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  I'd always loved coding. So shortly after graduation, feeling unhappy with my job prospects of more bartending, I decided to start taking my self-education seriously. This eventually led to finding entry level tech work. Currently, I lead a small team in developing websites and building SEO presence for several businesses. Meanwhile, I continue my personal study, always trying to build my knowledge of technology, programming, and software development. 
  <br>
  <br>
  It has always been important to me to continuously evolve as a person and grow my abilities, and the world of technology offers endless opportunities to do just that. I find myself excited every day to continue my growth and explore all that this industry has to offer!
