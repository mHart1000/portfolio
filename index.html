		<p>
			Software development is the closest thing we have to magic. We've put energy into rocks, and with a combination of time, focus and esoteric symbols that control that energy, we can turn our ideas into reality. We have the power to build tools that solve almost any problem, share knowledge across the planet in an instant, and utilize data-driven approaches to making lives better. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time, writing software today comes with real responsibility. We’re building in a world where technology is routinely used for theft, propaganda, data-hoarding, and quiet forms of manipulation. That makes privacy and security non-negotiable. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I design systems that collect the minimum data needed, store it safely, and give users real control over how it’s used. Security isn’t just about patching vulnerabilities, it’s about respecting boundaries. I assume that everything I build may someday be attacked or misused and I plan accordingly. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I ship software that’s not only fast, reliable, and intuitive but also transparent, accountable, and secure. Users put their trust in us when they use our products, and I take that responsibility very seriously.

		<p>It's been consistently shown that if a page doesn't load within the first couple seconds, many users will just click away, never to return. Not to mention the fact that Google punishes slow sites in search results. I build fast and efficient sites from the ground up, but am also highly-skilled at speeding up old sites that are having performance issues.</p>
